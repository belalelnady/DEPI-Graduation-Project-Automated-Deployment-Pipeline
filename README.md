# DEPI-Graduation-Project-Automated-Deployment-Pipeline-Plan

### **Objective**
Implement an automated CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, Docker, and Ansible to automate the build, testing, and deployment of a sample application.

### **Description**
This pipeline automates the lifecycle of the application, from code changes to production deployment. The CI/CD pipeline will:
- Use Jenkins for continuous integration to automate code builds and tests.
- Utilize Docker for containerization to ensure consistent environments.
- Implement Ansible for configuration management and deployment tasks.
- Perform automated testing and deploy the application to Docker containers running on a cloud VM or server.

### **Pipeline Overview**

#### **1. Pipeline Architecture**
- **Source Control**: Codebase hosted on GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket.
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Jenkins pulls code changes, builds Docker images, and runs tests.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Ansible handles configuration and deployment of Docker containers on a cloud VM (e.g., AWS EC2, GCP Compute Engine, Azure VM).

#### **2. Tools and Technologies**
- **Jenkins**: Orchestrates the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Docker**: Containerizes applications for consistent deployments.
- **Ansible**: Manages configuration and automates deployment tasks.
- **Cloud Environment**: AWS, GCP, or Azure for hosting the deployment environment.

### **3. Detailed Pipeline Stages**

#### **Stage 1: Source Control**
- **Purpose**: Manage code versions and trigger the pipeline on code changes.
- **Details**: Set up webhooks in GitHub/GitLab to trigger Jenkins builds on commits or pull requests.

#### **Stage 2: Continuous Integration (Build and Test)**
- **Purpose**: Automate the build and test process to ensure code quality.
- **Tools**: Jenkins, Docker.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Clone Repository**: Jenkins pulls the latest code from the source control system.
  2. **Build Docker Image**: Jenkins builds a Docker image using the `Dockerfile` defined in the repository.
  3. **Run Tests**: Execute unit tests, integration tests, and other quality checks inside the Docker container using Jenkins.
  4. **Publish Docker Image**: Push the tested Docker image to a Docker registry (Docker Hub, AWS ECR, GCP Artifact Registry).

#### **Stage 3: Continuous Deployment (Deploy)**
- **Purpose**: Deploy the Docker container to a cloud VM.
- **Tools**: Terraform, Ansible, Docker.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Configuration Management**: Use Ansible to configure the cloud VM environment, ensuring Docker is installed and running.
  2. **Deploy Docker Container**: Ansible pulls the latest Docker image from the registry and runs it on the cloud VM.
  3. **Verification**: Perform health checks to ensure the application is running correctly.

### **4. Configuration and Setup**

#### **1. Jenkins Setup**
- Install Jenkins on a server or cloud VM.
- Install necessary plugins: Docker, Ansible, GitHub/GitLab Integration.
- Set up credentials for Docker registry, Git, and cloud provider access.

#### **2. Docker Setup**
- Create a `Dockerfile` to define the application environment and dependencies.
- Use multi-stage builds to optimize image size.

#### **3. Ansible Setup**
- Create Ansible playbooks for configuring the VM and deploying the Docker container.
- Ensure that the VM has Docker installed and is configured to pull and run the latest Docker images.

#### **4. Cloud VM Setup**
- Provision a VM on your chosen cloud provider (AWS EC2, GCP Compute Engine, Azure VM).
- Configure security groups, firewalls, and access controls to allow Jenkins and Ansible access.

### **5. Environments**
- **Development**: Initial testing environment with automated deployment on every code commit.
- **Staging**: A more stable environment for testing the entire application stack.
- **Production**: Final environment where the application is made available to end users.

### **6. Pipeline Triggers**
- **Automated Triggers**: Pipeline triggered by code commits, pull requests, or tag creation.
- **Manual Triggers**: Optional manual deployment approvals for staging and production.

### **7. Error Handling and Troubleshooting**
- **Build Failures**: Check Jenkins build logs for errors related to Docker build or testing.
- **Deployment Issues**: Ansible logs will provide details about any deployment failures or misconfigurations.

### **8. Best Practices**
- Use environment variables for sensitive information like credentials and configuration details.
- Implement automated rollback mechanisms in case of failed deployments.
- Monitor the running Docker containers using tools like Prometheus or Grafana.

### **9. Security Considerations**
- Secure Jenkins with appropriate access controls.
- Manage Docker secrets and Ansible vaults securely for credentials and sensitive configurations.

### **10. FAQs**
- **Q: How to handle build failures?**  
  A: Review the Jenkins build logs to identify errors during Docker image creation or testing phases.

- **Q: What if the deployment fails?**  
  A: The Ansible playbook should have error handling to rollback the container to a previous stable state.

### **Documentation Review and Maintenance**
- Regularly update the documentation to reflect any changes in the pipeline or deployment strategy.
- Gather feedback from the team to improve documentation clarity and usefulness.

### **Conclusion**
This plan outlines the steps to set up an automated CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, Docker, and Ansible, focusing on continuous integration, automated testing, and cloud deployment of Docker containers. The pipeline is designed to ensure consistent and reliable deployments across development, staging, and production environments.
